# Task 4: Login & Registration Page

This folder contains the front-end implementation of a simple Login and Registration page. It demonstrates basic form handling, client-side validation, and styling.

## Files:

- `Login&Registration_Sanniv.html`: The main HTML file that structures the login and registration forms. It includes input fields for username, email, password, and respective buttons.
- `Login&Registration_Sanniv.css`: The CSS file responsible for the visual styling of the login and registration page. It defines the layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design elements.
- `Login&Registration_Sanniv.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the interactive aspects of the forms. This includes client-side form validation (e.g., checking for empty fields, password strength, email format) and toggling between login and registration views.

## Features:

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account with a username, email, and password.

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be viewable on various screen sizes.

## Usage:
